        review: "Not only is it the best Chinese food place in Angus, I would say it has some of the best Chinese food in Barrie and surrounding areas. Panda Express is horrible!! Try this place out you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Btw try their Shanghai Noodles. I can always tell if a place has good Chinese food if they can make good Shanghai noodles.",
